#Pilot Geocoderen Oorlogsbronnen

In [Netwerk Oorlogsbronnen](http://www.oorlogsbronnen.nl/) metadata of war-related collections are aggregated. This pilot explores the ways these metadata can be geocoded.

##documents

The [Eindrapportage Pilot Geocoderen Oorlogsbronnen](documents/rapportage.md) (Dutch!) you will find the findings of this pilot (and nice examples of some freak results - like geocoding 'Anne Frank' to a street of that name in Bunschoten-Spakenburg).

In [gelderlander-documentatie.md](documents/gelderlander-documentatie.md) (Dutch!) you will find the results of a small test we did with extracting geographical names from wartime newspapers.

##scripts

##fun

We made a [World Map of False Positives](http://islandsofmeaning.nl/projects/falsepositives/) with war related street- and placenames: Anne Frank, Spitfire, Axis, Uniform, Zuidfront, Het Verzet, etc.
