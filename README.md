#Pilot Geocoderen Oorlogsbronnen

In [Netwerk Oorlogsbronnen](http://www.oorlogsbronnen.nl/) metadata of war-related collections are aggregated. This pilot explores the ways these metadata can be geocoded.

##documents

In [gelderlander-documentatie.md](documents/gelderlander-documentatie.md) you will find the results of a small test we did with extracting geographical names from wartime newspapers.

##scripts
